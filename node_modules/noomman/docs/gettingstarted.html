            <h2>Installing Noomman</h2>
            <p>
                Noomman is an npm package and can be installed using npm. 
                Simply run the following command from the directory of your node project.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
npm install --save noomman
                </code>

            </pre>

            <h2>Connecting To Your Database</h2>
            <p>
                To connect noomman to your database, use the noomman.connect() method. The method takes two arguments,
                the uri string for the connection, and the name of the database. Call connect when your app starts, usually 
                in your app.js file.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
const noomman = require('noomman');

...
const uri = "mongodb+srv://some:uri@somewhere"
const databaseName = "testdatabase";

await noomman.connect(uri, databaseName);

OR

noomman.connect(uri, databaseName).then( () => {
    ...
});

            <h2>Creating Your First Class Model</h2>
            <p>
                Create a Class Model, which tells noomman the expected shape and types of your data. The ClassModel constructor
                accepts an object containing the schema for the ClassModel. The schema is explained in depth 
                <a href="./documentation/ClassModel.html#schema">here</a>, 
                but must 
                at least contain a class name. Noomman has two main flavors of data it can store for your ClassModel.
                Attributes store simple types like Strings, Numbers, Dates, and Booleans. Relationships store
                Object Ids of related instances. Both Attributes and Relationships can be singular or non-singular.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is an example of a simple Animal Class Model. An animal has a name, and relationships to its parent animals.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
const noomman = require('noomman');
const ClassModel = noomman.ClassModel;

const Animal = new ClassModel({
    className: 'Animal',
    attributes: [
        {
            name: 'name',
            type: String,
        },
    ],
    relationships: [
        {
            name: 'parents',
            toClass: 'Animal',
            singular: false,
        }
    ]
});

module.exports = Animal;
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="docs-section" id="usingClassModel">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Using Your Class Model</h2>
            <p>
                Once you have created your Class Model, you can start to use it. In noomman, there is a special class
                called Instance which you can use to create instances of your Class Model. You do this by calling new Instance()
                and passing in the desired Class Model.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
const noomman = require('noomman');
const Animal = require('./Animal');
const Instance = noomman.Instance;

// create an Instance of Animal
const animal = new Instance(Animal);
                </code>

            </pre>

            <p>
                Instances have built in methods to help you assign properties and interact with the database. Properties can
                be assigned directly, or using the Instance.assign() method. Continuing from the previous example we asign the 
                animal a name.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
animal.name = "Stewart";

OR 

animal.assign({
    name: "Stewart",
});
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Now we can call Instance.save() to save our animal named Stewart to the database.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
await animal.save();
                </code>

            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="docs-section" id="queries">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Querying</h2>
            <p>
                All queries in noomman are executed using static methods on the ClassModel of the instance(s) you wish
                to find. There are 3 such methods, 
                <a href="./documentation/ClassModel.html#find">ClassModel.find()</a>,
                <a href="./documentation/ClassModel.html#findOne">ClassModel.findOne()</a>,
                <a href="./documentation/ClassModel.html#findById">ClassModel.findById()</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                If we wish to find the instance of Animal named Stewart, we might use the findOne() method. Both find()
                and findOne() accept a query object as the first parameter. These query objects are expected to be valid
                mongodb query filters. The findOne() method returns a promise which will resolve to the the first instance
                of the ClassModel which matches the query filter, or null if no such instance is found. 
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
// find an Instance of Animal with name equal to Stewart.
const stewart = await Animal.findOne({
    name: "Stewart",
});
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                We could do the same thing with the find() method. The only difference is that find() will return a Promise which
                resolves to another class called an InstanceSet, rather than an Instance. An InstanceSet is subclass of the 
                native JS Set class, which contains Instances of a particular Class Model, and provides some more helpful methods 
                to work with. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is an example of find() to find the same Instance of Animal with the name Stewart. In this case, we have
                an extra step to extract the actual Instance itself from the InstanceSet. In this case, we accomplish this
                by 
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax">spreading</a> 
                the InstanceSet into a normal Array, and then extracting the first element.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
// find all Instances of Animal with name equal to Stewart.
const animalsNamedStewart = await Animal.find({
    name: "Stewart",
});

// get the first instance from the set.
const stewart = [...animalsNamedStewart][0];
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                The findById() method is similar to findOne() except that it excepts an ObjectId as an argument.
                If we already have the ObjectId for the instance of Animal with the name Stewart, then we could 
                find it like this...
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
// set a variable to the ObjectId of the Instance of Animal with the name Stewart
const stewartId = stewart._id;

// Pass the ObjectId to the findById method to retrieve the instance from the database.
const alsoStewart = await Animal.findById(stewartId);
                </code>
            </pre>

    <div class="docs-section" id="relationships">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Working With Relationships</h2>
            <p>
                So far we've set an attribute for an Instance. Now let's try setting a relationship to other instances.
                To set a relationship, you simply set the relationship property on an Instance to an Instance or InstanceSet 
                of the approiate related Class Model, using either the Instance.assign() method or by assigning the property
                value directly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our Animal Class Model was defined with a non-singular relationship to other Animals named "parents". Because
                this is a non-singular relationship, we need to set it to an InstanceSet of class Animal. Here is how we
                might accomplish this task. First we create two more Animals, group them into an InstanceSet, and then 
                assign the InstanceSet to the "parents" property. Finally we save the original Instance back to the database.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
// find an Instance of Animal with name equal to Stewart.
const stewart = await Animal.findOne({
    name: "Stewart",
});

// create two more animals which will be the parents of Stewart
const john = new Instance(Animal);
const jill = new Instance(Animal);

// give the parents names
john.name = "John";
jill.name = "Jill"

// create an InstanceSet of ClassModel Animal containing the two parents
const parentsOfStewart = new InstanceSet(Animal, [john, jill]);

// save John and Jill to the database
await parentsOfStewart.save();

// set the parents property of Stewart to the parents InstanceSet.
stewart.parents = parentsOfStewart;

// save stewart
await stewart.save();
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                Now Stewart has two parents! Good for him. Notice that we were able to save both John and Jill
                in a single line of code by calling InstanceSet.save(), which will save all the Instances contained
                in the InstanceSet. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Relationships have another powerful use in noomman. If we were working with the raw mongodb driver
                for javascript, we would first have to get the ObjectIds contained in the relationship, and then run
                another query to retrieve the actual Instances. In noomman we call this operation 'walking' a relationship,
                and it is as simple as getting the relationship property from an Instance.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
// find an Instance of Animal with name equal to Stewart.
const stewart = await Animal.findOne({
    name: "Stewart",
});

// get an InstanceSet containing Stewart's parents.
const parentsOfStewart = await stewart.parents;

// log the names of stewart's parents so we can see if this worked.
parentsOfStewart.forEach(parent => console.log(parent.name));

// outputs:
// John
// Jill
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                This deserves some explanation. Calling "stewart.parents" actualy executes a query for the related Instances,
                populates the parents property on Stewart so that if called again, we can skip the query, and then returns
                a Promise which resolves to an InstanceSet containing the related Instances. Also shown here, we can use 
                InstanceSet.forEach() method to loop through all the Instances in the InstanceSet and execute some code.

            <h2>Inheritance</h2>
            <p>
                The true power and differentiator of noomman in the ability for Class Models to inherit from 
                one another. Class Models can inherit from multiple other Class Models. Every aspect of a Class
                Model is inheritable, including attributes, relationships, validations, methods, and more. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lets create a couple sub Class Models of our Animal Class Model. One wil be Human, and
                the other Pet.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
// Human.js
const noomman = require('noomman');
const Animal = require('./Animal');
const ClassModel = noomman.ClassModel;

const Human = new ClassModel({
    className: 'Human',
    superClasses: [ Animal ],
    attributes: [
        {
            name: 'dateOfBirth',
            type: Date,
        },
    ],
    relationships: [
        {
            name: 'pets',
            toClass: 'Pet',
            singular: false,
            mirrorRelationship: 'owner',
        }
    ],
});

module.exports = Human;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre>
                <code>
// Pet.js
const noomman = require('noomman');
const Animal = require('./Animal');
const ClassModel = noomman.ClassModel;

const Pet = new ClassModel({
    className: 'Pet',
    superClasses: [ Animal ],
    attributes: [
        {
            name: 'adoptedOn',
            type: Date,
        },
    ],
    relationships: [
        {
            name: 'owner',
            toClass: 'Human',
            singular: true,
            mirrorRelationship: 'pets',
        }
    ],
});

module.exports = Pet;
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                Inheritance is accomplished by including all the super Class Models for a sub Class Model within
                the "superClasses" property of the sub Class Model's schema. In our example, both Human and Pet have 
                Animal as a super Class Model. This means that both Human and Pet also have a "name" attribute and a 
                "parents" relationship.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition we add new Date-type attributes "dateOfBirth" for Human and "adoptedOn"
                for Pet. We add a non-singular relationship from Human to Pet called "pets" and a singular
                relationship from Pet to Human called "owner". These two relationships are actually two
                sides of a 1:Many relationship. They are connected to one another with the "mirrorRelationship"
                property, which is used to declare the other side of the two-way relationship. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Now that Animal has sub Class Models, we may decide that we shouldn't be creating instances of Animal
                itself. To accomplish this, lets add the "abstract" property to our Animal class schema. This will
                have noomman throw an error if any code attempts to create an Instance of Animal directly by 
                calling new Instance(Animal).
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
const noomman = require('noomman');

const Animal = new ClassModel({

        {
            name: 'name',

module.exports = Animal;

            </pre>

            <p>
                Lets create a Human and two Animals for the following examples to use. 
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>

            <p>
                We've created some data to work with. This is a good time to make a point about two-way 
                relationships. Noomman enforces two-way relationship consistency, which means that when
                you save an Instance with a change to a two-way relationship, noomman will update the other side
                of the relatationship and save the related instances as well. For example, the following code 
                is functionally equivalent to the above.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
// create Instances of Human and Pet
const jessica = new Instance(Human);
const fluffy = new Instance(Pet);
const spot = new Instance(Pet);

// assign attributes and relationships to human
jessica.assign({
    name: "Jessica",
    dateOfBirth: new Date('2000-01-01');
    pets: new InstanceSet(Pet, [fluffy, spot]);
});

// assign attributes and relationships to pets
fluffy.assign({
    name: "Fluffy",
    adoptedOn: new Date('2019-01-01'),
});

spot.assign({
    name: "Spot",
    adoptedOn: new Date('2019-06-01'),
});

// save our instances
await human.save();
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                Because the "pets" relationship on Human is a two-way relationship, setting the "pets" relationship
                for Jessica will set the "owner" relationship for the related pets when Jessica is saved. When we 
                do call save on Jessica, noomman sets the other side of the relationship for each Pet, and saves 
                those Pets in their current state. This is why we don't need to call save on fluffy or spot. Note that
                noomman also tracks changes to Instances since last save, so in the previous example, the calls to save
                fluffy and spot do not actually make a call to the database, because fluffy and spot have no changes 
                on them since being saved as part of saving Jessica. 
            </p>
            <p>
                TLDR: calling save explicitly on each instance
                is not necessary in this case, but also doesn't cause any extra database calls. It's up to the developer
                whether they want to make the extra calls (for peace of mind or readability) or omit them (for cleaner,
                more exact code).
            </p>

            <h4>Querying From Super Class Model</h4>

            <p>
                Since both Human and Pet are sub Class Models of Animal, we could query on the Animal class to find
                them (as opposed to querying on Human or Pet). For example, what if we wanted to find
                any Animal with the name Jessica (be it a Human or a Pet). We could do the following.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
// find all Instances of Animal with a name equal to "Jessica".
const allAnimalsNamedJessica = Animal.find({
    name: "Jessica"
});
               </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                Assuming we only have the data created above in the system, this will return an InstanceSet
                for Class Model Animal containing an Instance of Human that has the name Jessica. If we had
                an Instnace of Pet in the database with name equal to "Jessica", that would also be included
                in the InstanceSet. Noomman allows you to easily query for all Instances of a Class Model
                and all that Class Model's children, all the way down the inhertance tree.
            </p>

            <h4>Relationships to a Super Class Model</h4>
            <p>
                Both our Human and Pet Class Model's inherit the "parents" relationship from Animal. That 
                relationship was declared as a relationship from Animal to Animal. As is, this means that 
                any Animal could be a parent to any other Animal. This is not quite how biology works, but
                it does allow a good example of a relationship that can be populated by different Instances
                of different Class Models. Just for fun, lets set Jessica as the parent of the two pets.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
const petParent  = new InstanceSet(Human, [jessica]);
fluffy.parents = petParent;
spot.parents = petParent;

await fluffy.save();
await spot.save();
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                Here we have set the parents of Fluffy and Spot to be Jessica. So even, though the "parents"
                relationship is to an Animal, we can set it to any InstanceSet containing Instances of 
                any sub Class Model of Animal.
            </p>
