            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Noomman provides a comprehensive object management system for application development. Unlike
                other MongoDB client libraries, Noomman is designed to follow strict object-oriented principals.
                Noomman allows multiple layers of inheritance, inheritance from multiple parents, and abstract 
                class models. This inheritance applies to every aspect of the schema.
                All code for a given class model can be encapsulated in a single .js file, including 
                the schema, as well as functions for CRUD control and validation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Developers create class models using a schema object to define valid data structure, inheritance,
                CRUD controls, and auditablility. Noomman manages a MongoDB database for holding the data, and 
                abstracts away updating operations, so developers only have to make their desired changes to the data and 
                then call Noomman to save it. Noomman provides a consistent API for CRUD operations, enforcing 
                data consistency, validation, and security. Noomman also abstracts away common querying operations so that 
                developers can traverse and filter the model in an object-oriented manner. 
            </p>
            <h5>Database Schema</h5>
            <p>
                Developers provide a schema for each class model in in the form of a Javascript object. The schema 
                describes the attributes and relationships for a class, inheritance properties, CRUD controls, 
                auditablility and validations. Noomman implements classical inheritance in its object model, 
                allowing multi-level, and multi-parent inheritance, and providing easy querying with respect 
                to inheritance. All properties of a schema, including validation and CRUD control functions,
                are inherited from a super class model to a sub class model. 
            </p>
            <h5>Data Consistency</h5>
            <p>
                For each relationship on a class, the developer will also describe the cardinality, 
                directionality, and ownership properties of the relationship in their database schema. 
                With this information Noomman is able to ensure data consistency. Everytime you update 
                one side of a two-way relationship on an instance, Noomman will update the relationships on the 
                instances related through that relationship, ensuring that both directions of the 
                relationship stay in sync. If you ask Noomman to delete an instance that has an owns 
                relationship to another instance, Noomman will perform a cascading delete to ensure 
                there are no orphaned instances.
            </p>
            <h5>Create, Read, Update, and Delete Control</h5>
            <p>
                Noomman provides a dynamic framework for controlling in what circumstances any object may be
                created, read, updated, or deleted. CRUD privileges can be programmatically defined by providing an
                asynchronus function in the class model schema for a class. These functions should throw an error if 
                the operation is not allowed, and resolve otherwise. Each CRUD operation can have its own function 
                for determining if a particular operation is allowed, or you can use the same function for multiple 
                operations.
            </p>
            <h5>Update History</h5>
            <p>
                A Noomman class model has an option called auditable. With this option enabled, Noomman will 
                keep a changelog for every update of every instance of the class model. This changelog will be 
                viewable to the developer or admin account, and will keep track of who made each change and 
                when each change was made. Objects can be completely reversed to any point in time using this 
                changelog. If you choose not to delete the change log for an instance when that instance is deleted, 
                you can completely recover a deleted instance using the change log information.
            </p>
            <h5>Implementation</h5>
            <p>
                Noomman is a nodejs package. It uses the native MongoDB javascript client to communicate with a mongo 
                database, or a database that can be used with the native mongo client.
